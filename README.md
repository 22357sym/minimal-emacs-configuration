===========================

Minimal emacs configuration for Python.

To get everything working correctly
- pip install jedi epc pylint
- clone this repository
- start emacs as "emacs -Q"
- visit the file "init.el" and M-x eval-buffer

If everything goes file you'll get all the needed packages installed and a nice configuration for Python and git.
